# Software Defined Vehicle Maps

This repository is a collection of various key visuals for Software Defined Vehicle topics, initiatives and other collateral.

## Map of the Software Defined Car

This is what I call the map of the software defined car.

It's something between advanced buzzword bingo and a well curated topic map with a bit of visual appealing design.
Some crossings have a meaning, but not all. A missed topic does not mean it's not important.
And yes, using a metro map to depict automotive topics may feel a bit awkward but I don't care.

## Map of SDV-related initiatives

This is an attempt to visualize all (some of) the various initiatives and communities that are working on aspects of software defined vehicles, in-vehicle software, etc.
It is inspired by [rocket science](https://deltavmap.github.io) - very loosely.
